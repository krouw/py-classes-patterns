# Python Classes Patterns 

In this repository, we have implemented in python different design patterns used through classes. To do this, these patterns have been implemented using native python classes, dataclasses, attr, cattrs and pydantic, in order to analyze and evaluate the best alternatives when implementing these patterns.
