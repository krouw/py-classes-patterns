# Python Classes Patterns 

In this repository, the python implementation of different design patterns used by means of classes has been carried out. To do this, these patterns have been implemented using native python classes, dataclasses, attr, cattrs and pydantic, in order to analyze and evaluate the best alternatives when implementing these patterns.
